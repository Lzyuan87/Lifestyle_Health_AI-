/*
Explanation of the implementation:

We define a list lifestyle_health_relationships that contains relationships between users, lifestyle factors, health metrics, and their effects. Each relationship is represented as a dictionary with keys "user", "lifestyle_factor", "health_metric", and "effect".
The infer_health_effect function takes a user, a lifestyle factor, and a health metric as input and iterates through the lifestyle_health_relationships list to find a matching relationship. If a match is found, it returns the effect of the lifestyle factor on the health metric; otherwise, it returns None.
We demonstrate the usage of the system by providing an example user, lifestyle factor, and health metric, and printing the inferred effect.
This implementation follows the logical representation provided in FOL, where ∀x∀y∀z (User(x) ∧ Lifestyle_Factor(y) ∧ Health_Metric(z) ∧ Affects(y, z)). It allows us to infer how lifestyle factors affect health metrics for different users based on predefined relationships.

In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more complex relationships, incorporate additional factors such as time, age, and genetics, and potentially integrate the system with a user interface for input/output and a database for storing and updating relationships.
