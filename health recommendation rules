/*
Explanation of the implementation:

We define a dictionary health_recommendation_rules to store recommendation rules for different health conditions. Each key-value pair represents a health condition and its corresponding recommendation rule.
The get_recommendations function takes a health condition as input and retrieves the recommendation rule for that health condition from the health_recommendation_rules dictionary. If no recommendation rule is found for the given health condition, it returns a default message indicating that no recommendations are available.
We demonstrate the usage of the system by retrieving recommendations for the "flu" health condition.
This implementation follows the logical representation provided in FOL, where ∀x∀y (Health_Condition(x) ∧ Recommendation(y) ∧ Recommendation_Rule(x, y)). It allows us to store and retrieve recommendation rules for different health conditions and provide recommendations based on input health conditions.

In a real-world scenario, you would need to expand the system to support more health conditions, handle additional functionalities such as personalized recommendations and feedback collection, and potentially integrate the system with a user interface for input/output and a database for storing and querying recommendation rules.
