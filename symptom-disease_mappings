/*
Explanation of the implementation:

We define a list symptom_disease_mappings that contains mappings between symptoms and diseases. Each mapping is represented as a dictionary with keys "symptom" and "disease".
The infer_disease function takes a list of symptoms as input and iterates through the symptom_disease_mappings list to find matching mappings. If a symptom matches a symptom in the mapping, the corresponding disease is added to the set of inferred diseases.
Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the system by providing a list of symptoms and printing the inferred diseases.
This implementation follows the logical representation provided in first-order logic (FOL), where ∀x∀y (Symptom(x) ∧ Disease(y) ∧ Symptom_Disease(x, y)). It allows us to infer possible diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more complex relationships between symptoms and diseases, as well as potential uncertainties and exceptions. Additionally, you might consider integrating this system with a user interface for input/output and potentially with other components such as a knowledge base or database for storing and updating symptom-disease mappings.
